Copied from dumpasn1.c:

   ASN.1 data display code, copyright Peter Gutmann 
   <pgut001@cs.auckland.ac.nz>, based on ASN.1 dump program by David Kemp, 
   with contributions from various people including Matthew Hamrick, Bruno 
   Couillard, Hallvard Furuseth, Geoff Thorpe, David Boyce, John Hughes, 
   'Life is hard, and then you die', Hans-Olof Hermansson, Tor Rustad, 
   Kjetil Barvik, James Sweeny, Chris Ridd, David Lemley, John Tobey, James 
   Manger and several other people whose names I've misplaced.

   You can use this code in whatever way you want, as long as you don't try 
   to claim you wrote it.

   (Someone asked for clarification on what this means, treat it as a very 
   mild form of the BSD license in which you're not required to include LONG 
   LEGAL DISCLAIMERS IN ALL CAPS but just a small note in a corner somewhere 
   (e.g. the back of a manual) that you're using the dumpasn1 code.  And if 
   you do use it, please make sure you're using a recent version, I 
   occasionally see screen shots from incredibly ancient versions that are
   nowhere near as good as what current versions produce).

   Editing notes: Tabs to 4, phasers to malky (and in case anyone wants to
   complain about that, see "Program Indentation and Comprehensiblity",
   Richard Miara, Joyce Musselman, Juan Navarro, and Ben Shneiderman,
   Communications of the ACM, Vol.26, No.11 (November 1983), p.861) */
